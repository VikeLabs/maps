# maps

This is a [VikeLabs](https://www.vikelabs.ca/) project meant for navigating around the University of Victoria.

## Contributing

If you are new to open-source, this is a great place to start! Opening issues, requesting features, and finding gaps in documentation are all useful!

Code contributions are welcome, information about contributing to the backend and frontend specifically are found
in `app/README.md` and `api/README.md`. More general instructions are below.
___

#### 1. Find an issue that you feel that you can tackle

Ones labeled "Good first Issue" are good places to start.

#### 2. Say you are interested in working on the issue

In order to make sure two people aren't doing the same thing at once, add a comment to the issue saying you are
interested in working on it.

#### 3. Fork the repository

There is a button in the top right of the GitHub repository that says fork, click it! This will create an exact copy of
this repository but in your own GitHub account.

#### 4. Clone your repository

`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/maps`

#### 5. Fix the issue!

This is the hard part, but if you are confused with anything or want some pointers on how to fix it, feel free to ask in
the issue thread.

#### 6. Add the files you committed to the staging area

`git add THE_FIXED_FILES`

#### 7. Commit the staged files

`git commit -m "some nice message here"`

#### 8. Push your changes!

`git push`

#### 9. Contribute the changes

There should be a nice green button labeled Contribute in *your* repository. Click it and attach a title and description
describing what you have done. If you have some changes and are looking for feedback or help, mention that in the
description.

#### 10. Wait for someone to look over the changes and merge them.

There are automatic tests and a required code review, if everything is in ship shape, the change will be merged.
